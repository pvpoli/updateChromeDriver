# updateChromeDriver
Small python script to update chrome driver to the last stable version. 

# How to use
Run updateChromeDriver.py. The runner should ask for the install destination as well as the intended platform. 
If no answer is given, by default chromedriver will be installed for win64 on the execution location.

Do whatever you want with this script. Wanna copy it? Go on, my man! Wanna send it to your grandmother? I suppose she won't enjoy it as much as you might think but, hey!, I'm not here to judge.
